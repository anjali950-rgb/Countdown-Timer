# Countdown-Timer
This countdown timer is a tool that counts down from a specified time to zero. It displays the remaining time in units like days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Once the timer reaches zero, it triggers an action like showing a message.
# Technologies Used:
•	HTML5 – For structuring the layout and input fields.
•	CSS3 – For styling the user interface.
•	JavaScript – For implementing the countdown logic and real-time updates.
# Project Objective
To create an interactive countdown timer that:
•	Accepts a future target date and time from the user.
•	Starts and updates the countdown in real-time.
•	Displays remaining time dynamically.
•	Notifies the user when the countdown ends.
# How to Use
1.	Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2.	Set the Target Date using the date input field.
3.	Set the Target Time using the time input field.
4.	Click the Start button to begin the countdown.
5.	Watch the countdown update in real-time.
6.	When the target time is reached, a message “Countdown Complete!” will be displayed.

# How it works
•	The user selects a date and time.
•	On clicking the Start button, the startCountdown() function is triggered.
•	JavaScript calculates the difference between the current time and the target time.
•	Using setInterval(), the remaining time is updated every second.
•	The display shows the time left in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
•	Once the countdown reaches 0, it stops the interval and shows a completion message.

Features:
•	Clean and responsive UI.
•	Real-time countdown updates
•	Error handling for missing input.
•	Accurate time calculation.

# Future Enhancements
•	Add pause and reset buttons.
•	Support multiple timers.
•	Play a sound alert when the timer ends.
•	Allow styling customization (themes).
•	Store the timer state using localStorage to persist on refresh.
